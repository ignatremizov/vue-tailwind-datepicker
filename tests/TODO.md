# Testing TODOs

- TODO: Add browser-level interaction tests (Playwright/Cypress/Puppeteer) for selector mode and range picker UX flows.
- TODO: Cover keyboard focus-cycle behavior end-to-end (Tab/Shift+Tab, Escape, arrow navigation) in real browser conditions.
- TODO: Cover wheel scrolling edge cases (fractional/boundary year mode, fast flicks, viewport resize, runtime theme token changes).
